## Dashboard

ðŸŽ¬ [See it in action](https://heynicortiz.github.io/top_dashboard/) ðŸŽ¬

This is a dashboard design made using CSS Grid and Flexbox. There are a few minor Javascript functions implemented as well for responding to icon clicks such as up/down arrows and star on the main cards and the notification bell icon by the user information.

The design is responsive and as the screen size enlarges, the sidebar displays and the rest of the main content (announcements/trending) moves to a column on the right hand side.
